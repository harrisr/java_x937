Version 0.1.4 BREAKS PREVIOUS RELEASE (Released: 7/12/2012)
	1. Added Check Addendum Type C record.  
	2. ImageView.saveImage returns the saved File now instead of void


Version 0.1.3 BREAKS PREVIOUS RELEASE (Released: <not yet released>)
	1. Added image package as well as example writer.  It is NOT at this point doing anything useful other than demo'ing the ability to write on a template image.
	2. Fixed EBCDIC images (contributor Rick Fischer)
	3. Removed requirement (and ability for that matter) to specific the file encoding in the reader.  It is now determined at run time. (Contributor Marcin)
	4. Fixed field type of imagesWithinCashLetterCount and lengthImageReferenceKey in Cash Letter Control Record and Image View Data Record respectively. (Contributor Rick Fischer)
	5. In the event a field is only spaces it will be set using an empty string allowing the padder to control length.  
	6. Image length is trimmed when converted to an integer in the event it is space padded instead of zero padded.  
	7. Changed image compression to 200 dpi and ensure little endian byte order in TiffTextWriter



Version 0.1.2 BREAKS PREVIOUS RELEASE (Released: 4/1/2010)
	1. Updated TODO
	2. Added an encoding type to the file, reader and record reader classes
	3. Fixed a bug in the OnUsValidator that did not allow dashes
	4. Fixed a bug in the Bundle Header Record that had an invalid validator for the bundle ID
	5. Added the enum FileEncoding
	6. Changed the reader to convert EBCDIC records as it imports each record.  This is still a work in progress as I am having some trouble with iamges.
	7. Added EBCDIC support to the writer and tested output
